Standard Operating Procedure: Inventory Management Guidelines
-------------------------------------------------------------

Objective:
Maintain accurate inventory levels across MAIN and AUX locations to ensure production lines operate efficiently and minimize material shortages.

Categories:
- Electrical Components: Includes PLC modules, sensors, relays, and power supplies.
- Mechanical Parts: Bearings, couplings, shafts, and motor assemblies.
- Packaging Materials: Boxes, tape, film, and labels.
- Safety Supplies: PPE, gloves, eyewear, and spill kits.

Storage Locations:
- MAIN Warehouse: Houses high-value and frequently used parts.
- AUX Storage: Overflow and low-turnover items.

Inventory Value Policy:
- MAIN location should maintain 70% of the total inventory value.
- Categories with the highest value typically include Electrical Components and Mechanical Parts.
- Packaging Materials fluctuate monthly depending on production cycles.
- Safety Supplies account for less than 5% of the total value.

Cycle Counts:
- Weekly: Electrical Components and Mechanical Parts.
- Monthly: Packaging Materials.
- Quarterly: Safety Supplies.

Reorder Process:
1. Generate reorder list from MES system.
2. Verify critical components with line maintenance staff.
3. Submit purchase request to Procurement.
4. Receive parts and update ERP records within 24 hours.

Notes:
To reduce capital tied up in inventory, evaluate slow-moving SKUs every quarter. Move non-critical items from MAIN to AUX if not used within 6 months.
